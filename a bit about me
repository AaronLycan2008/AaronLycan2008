- 👋 Hi, I’m @AaronLycan2008
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, and hanging out with friends irl or online, I like to watch anime when I'm not with friends.
- my top 10 anime are One Piece, Demon Slayer, MHA, black clover, AOT, Blue Exorcist, the whole Naruto-based franchise, JJK, SAO, and Chainsaw Man
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to operate this site so maybe I could learn from someone who knows what the frick they're doing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I can code and play a type of Pixlemon with Eaglercraft and maybe we could play together or something sometime.
- 📫 How to reach me you should be able to email me at s.cantrell507@raypec.org.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an honest man who hates people who don't stick to their word, I'm a really good guy, and I'm a loyal friend.
someone you can talk to about anything and I'll listen to whatever you have to say whenever you want to say it I hope that whatever comes from this turns into a great friendship.
